Hi All

I done a project in object detection 

the object is pendrive 

the image used for the dataset is taken from my camera

the annotation has been done in roboflow 

then the model training for ML(machine learning) implementation using google collab

after that it was implemented in the rpi 5 with arduino nano 

from arduino nano we detect the distance using ultrasonic sensor and transmit data to rpi 5 using i2c bus

in this repository you will find overall code and each separate code for individual working 

Thank you
